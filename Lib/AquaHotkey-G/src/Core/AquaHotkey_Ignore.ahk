 * 
 * `AquaHotkey_Ignore` is a special marker class used to indicate that a class
 * should be excluded from AquaHotkey's class prototyping system. It serves as
 * a signal for AquaHotkey to skip over any class it is applied to, ensuring
 * that nested or non-prototyped classes do not undergo the class modification
 * that AquaHotkey typically performs on standard classes.
 * 
 * **When to use**:
 * 
 * - Extend the `AquaHotkey_Ignore` class to indicate that it should be ignored.
 * 
 * @example
 * 
 * class Tanuki extends AquaHotkey {
 *     class Util extends AquaHotkey_Ignore {
 *         ; this class will be ignored by AquaHotkey's prototyping
 *     }
 * }
